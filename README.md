## Neural Net

The repository is a collection of Implementations of various neural net model, including versions of keras and pytorch. Some models may not have exactly the same hyperparameter settings as the one described in the paper, as the purpose of the code is to reproduce the core idea.

More Implementations will be added gradually. Any suggestions and issues are welcomed.

**Note:** The codes are written and tested under **keras 2.4.2 (tensorflow 2.4.1 backend)** and **pytorch 1.8.2 LTS** environment.
